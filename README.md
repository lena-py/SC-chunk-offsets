# SC-chunk-offsets
first program for SC development!

The purpose of this program is to generate chunks offsets.
It currently contains two functions(excluding the main):
  next_offset
  print_offset


# Questions:
# Naming convention for variables, functions: spelling, underscores, short CapWords
# using constants: to be avoided?  10410
# Why does line 61 work?
# turtle world coordinates placement
# repeating variable, parameter names in functions
# where to do conversion?  in function or main function?
# commas or tabs?
# why does putting turtle into a function change the behavior of the set world coordinates?
